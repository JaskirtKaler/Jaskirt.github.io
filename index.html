    <h1>Cars</h1>
    <p>I have enjoyed cars since I was little and from the moment I was able to drive I always enjoyied Long Drives. I'm really intrested in Car modifications but since  I'm a college student so I have put that on hold. I like both gas and EV cars, EV hare fun with high acceleration but, I believe gas cars have more charisma when driving. Hearing the <strong> Turbo Spool </strong> or the <strong>Super Charger Wine.</strong> is the best part about them.</p>
